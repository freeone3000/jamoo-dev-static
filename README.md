This document is not intended to be a blog post. If you're reading this, hi! You probably want to [view the index](https://jamoo.dev/).

# Purpose

This is a personal blog for Jasmine Moore. It is hosted on GitHub Pages because they're free and durable and open-source,
and let me run some pretty complex actions for free as long as the project is public. As this is a blog post, intended to
be published, there's very little harm in letting everyone in the world see the raw markdown before it's converted. So,
GitHub Pages it is.

# Deployment
This is currently deployed using jekyll. See `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` for the deployment script.

# Incoming Links
As [good links don't break](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dont-ever-break-a-url-if-you-can-help-it), we will document 
every available link structure.

A blog post SHALL BE AVAILABLE by:
- `https://jamoo.dev/URL%20ENCODED%20TITLE.html`

The title is currently based on the filename. "NixOS WTF.md" becomes "NixOS%20WTF.html". This may change; the URL must not.
